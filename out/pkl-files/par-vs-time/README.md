Example plots as a function of time for:
- geds: baseline (shown in percentage variation wrt the mean value of first part of collected data), baseline RMS (from dsp/bl_std) - for HWpulser+FCtrigger events
- spms: calibrated energy in PE
- ch000: maximum of waveform (from dsp/wf_max) - for HWpulser+FCtrigger events

Values are shown for the whole run #25.
